#  Cube Rotation

I recently saw _The Brutalist_ in IMAX, and the quote above really stuck with me.  
I'm not sure if I fully understand it but, in doing this mini project, I sought to understand it better.

This project visualizes a cube rotating on a 2D plane, using Python's Turtle module and a bit of simple math. 
(This was a warmup coding exercise i thought of)
